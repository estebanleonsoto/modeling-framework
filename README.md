A Clojure library designed to provide a way to describe your domain models.

Along that, this library is planned to provide features that allow exporting the model to different scenarios, producing implementation 
of it in areas like database schemas, APIs, front-end forms, etc.

```clj
[modeling-framework "0.0.0"]
```

## Usage

This model can be used as input in the various functions that export it to other scenarios.
